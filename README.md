# yt-files
All the files used in my YouTube videos

## Audio Menu
This folder is for setting up a basic audio devices switcher using EWW as a front end. We essentially get the device names and set the devices using the provided scripts.

## Basic Widget
This folder provides some basic EWW config files of a skeletal widget so one can get started.

## EWW Hello World
Same as `Basic Widget` except is more primitive.

## Simple Launcher
The provided config.rasi file is for Rofi users wanting a simple and elegant app launcher.

## EWW Popup Demo
Basic source code of my bar configuration showing how you can use events to trigger window popups and closes in EWWW.
